# GALE_Libs

These are GALE Lua Libs.
A lot of them were initially written for Dyrt, Star Story or The Fairy TALE REVAMPED.
These libs should basically work in all applications using the GALE engine provided the required APIs are included inside the applications.

In general all these libs are zLib licensed and written by Jeroen Broks, UNLESS the license notice inside the library EXPLICITLY STATES otherwise.
Before using any of these libs yourself for whatever purpose (as some may some code which is even useful to non-GALE users) you must check these licenses.

These libs are just published here, for the good of the rest of us.

Enjoy!
